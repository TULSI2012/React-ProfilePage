        Welcome to the world of Tulsi Virtul Introduction! As a web developer, I
        am able to crafting the digital experiences that power the internet.
        With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I
        have the power to bring designs to life and create dynamic, interactive
        websites and web applications.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the front end, I utilized languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
        build the user interface and ensure a seamless, visually appealing
        experience for my users. From layout and styling to animations and
        interactivity, my expertise in these languages will shape how users
        engage with my creations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Meanwhile, on the back end, I worked with languages like Python,PHP, or
        JavaScript (Node.js) to develop server-side logic, manage databases, and
        handle the behind-the-scenes functionality of my web applications.
        Understanding server-client communication, databases, and server-side
        frameworks will be key as I build robust and scalable web solutions.With
        my diverse skill set spanning both front-end and back-end technologies,
        I have the flexibility and capability to tackle a wide range of projects
        and contribute to every stage of the web development process.{" "}
